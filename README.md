# FireNEWT: Nexus for Efficient Workload Testing
Welcome to FireNEWT (Nexus for Efficient Workload Testing), a comprehensive repository of queries and tests inspired by real-world data application production workloads. While industry-standard benchmarks like TPC-H have traditionally been used to gauge database performance, they often fall short in capturing the intricate complexities and unique demands found in actual production environments. To bridge this gap, we developed FireNEWTâ€”a benchmark designed to offer a more accurate and representative measure of the challenges faced in modern data environments.

This repository serves as a valuable toolkit for developers, database administrators, and researchers, providing the means to evaluate and enhance system performance under realistic operational loads. By focusing on real-world patterns, FireNEWT offers a practical approach to workload testing, ensuring that database systems are tested against the kinds of demands they will encounter in production.

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of benchmarks designed to simulate production workload patterns. These benchmarks are useful for evaluating the performance of database systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any benchmarks, ensure you have the following:

- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Appropriate database management system (e.g., Firebolt, PostgreSQL) is configured

#### Firebolt Prerequisites

Specifically for Firebolt, you will need to have the following:

- A Firebolt service account. You will need to provide the service account ID and secret to the benchmarking scripts for them to connect to and authenticate with the Firebolt API.
  See the relevent [documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts.html) for more information about service accounts.
- A Firebolt user associated with the service account, to assign the appropriate roles to access Firebolt resources such as databases and engines.
  See the relevent [documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/Guides/managing-your-organization/managing-users.html) for more information about users.
- A Firebolt database that the user has read and write access to.
- A Firebolt engine that the user can use. To test various engine configurations, you will either need existing engines with those configurations, or the ability to create or modify engines and operate them.
  See the relevent [documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/Guides/operate-engines/operate-engines.html) for more information about engines.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firebolt-db/firenewt.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd firenewt
```

Install necessary dependencies:
```bash
cd ./tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Running Benchmarks

To run a specific benchmark, navigate to its directory under the `/queries` folder and execute the corresponding script. For example:

1 cluster 1 node type L engine high QPS benchmark
```bash 
export FB_CLIENT_ID=...
export FB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export FB_ACCOUNT=...
export FB_ENGINE=...
export FB_DATABASE=...
export FB_API=api.app.firebolt.io

cd tools
python run_firenewt_concurrent_qps.py --concurrency 200 ../SQL/queries/firenewt_1tb_qps_0.csv ../SQL/queries/firenewt_1tb_qps_1.csv ../SQL/queries/firenewt_1tb_qps_2.csv ../SQL/queries/firenewt_1tb_qps_3.csv
```

10 clusters 1 type L engine high QPS benchmark
```bash 
export FB_CLIENT_ID=...
export FB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export FB_ACCOUNT=...
export FB_ENGINE=...
export FB_DATABASE=...
export FB_API=api.app.firebolt.io
