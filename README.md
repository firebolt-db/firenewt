# firebolt-benchmark-suite
Welcome to **firebolt-benchmark-suite**, a comprehensive repository of benchmark queries and tests derived from real-world data application production workload patterns. This repository aims to provide developers, database administrators, and researchers with a toolkit to measure and improve system performance under realistic operational loads.

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of benchmarks designed to simulate production workload patterns. These benchmarks are useful for evaluating the performance of database systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running any benchmarks, ensure you have the following:

- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Appropriate database management system (e.g., Firebolt, PostgreSQL) is configured

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/firebolt-benchmark-suite.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd firebolt-benchmark-suite
```

Install necessary dependencies (if any):


### Running Benchmarks

To run a specific benchmark, navigate to its directory under the `/queries` folder and execute the corresponding script. For example:

```bash 
This needs to be updated once we have it
cd queries/mysql
./run_benchmark.sh
```

## Repository Structure

- **/queries/**: Contains all benchmark queries, organized by database type.
- **/data/**: Includes scripts and links to datasets required for running benchmarks.
- **/results/**: Stores example results and performance metrics.
- **/scripts/**: Automation and utility scripts to facilitate benchmarking processes.
- **/docs/**: Additional documentation on benchmark methodology and detailed guides.
